All throughout high school, teachers have been pushing the message of not copying or plagiarising other people’s work. There are posters, assemblies, emails, print outs, and more all explaining how plagiarising is the work of the devil. College took a step further and threatens suspension, if not possibly expelled if caught claiming other people’s work as your own. My ICS professor decided to start this week by copying pixel by pixel, of some copyrighted legally owned domains.

## Semantic UI
Perhaps not pixel by pixel, but we try our best to mimic the website as best as we could. The framework we adapted was Semantic UI. This framework was extremely easy to adapt with example codes on their main website. A few lines of javascript source code and the webpage works like magic! We practiced recreating some of the public domain websites and made knockoff versions strictly for educational purposes.

## Performance
Initially, creating the webpages took a long time. There were specific keywords required to make the menu bars and drop-down buttons. Specifically, my first title bar took 27 minutes to create (that is an entire episode of Pokemon I missed out, including intro song, ending song, and commercials!) The rest of the webpage was exponentially easier, completing the middle portion under 15 minutes and 14 minutes for the foot bar. The weekly timed problems in-class were exponentially easier as well after completing the first initial menu bar. A lot of the code could be copy-pasted into different backgrounds and fonts to create different webpages.  Which, I found very interesting.

The webpages we visited to mimic all had a common theme: top navigation, content in the middle, footer navigation. This simple format has been engraved into web-developers as the standard, which is totally understandable. Websites with that specific format are easy to navigate and looks clean overall. Because the format was so simple, it was easy for our class to learn it as well.

## Overall
As a practice, we were asked to recreate any webpage of our choice. One of my favorite fried chicken franchise, Popeyes, was my choice. The main webpage had some kinks that were hard to deal with, but overall still followed the three portion format. Hopefully, Popeyes will hire me as their web developer so I can receive free fried chicken. Regardless, Semantic UI was fun and rewarding to learn, with a minimal learning curve.
